				<h3 class="h3">My Coding Journy</h3>
				<p class="p">Even from a yong age the idea of making my own games fasinated me.
							 I always had ideas for things<br>
							 When I got my fist laptop I tried useing game maker studio to make
							 a few small games but it wasn't until I developed an interest in
							 creating mods for Minecraft that I finaly decided to learn to code.
							 <br>I started out just making simple command line applications to
							 write and compile files for me but After finding some tutorials
							 online that recommended Unity and trying it out I was hooked.<br>
							 I started watching a following all the decent totorials I could
							 find and though most projects didn't get completed I eventuly
							 began to join game jams.<br>
							 Now some stuff</p>
